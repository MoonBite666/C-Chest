# C-Chest

This branch is abolished, please use another branch.

## Why?

This Branch tried to develop "dual-buffer display", which turned out a completely failure.

The current main branch solved blink screen problem by a tricky way, so we don't need this branch at all.

If the dual-buffer is needed, better introduce other libs rather than the fuxxing Windows Console API.
