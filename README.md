# C-Chest

This Branch had been abolished, please use another branch.

## Why?

This Branch is about making "Undo" feature. Developer tried to push entire maps into stack and pop them back when needed, which was actually a waste of memory.

Rather than the map, devoloper had decided to push a "history command" into the stack and that will perform much better than this branch. Finally, the "history command" version will be developed and merged into main branch while this one being abolished.
